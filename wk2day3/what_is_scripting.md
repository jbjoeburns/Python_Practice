## Why is python popular?
The main appeal of Python is its large repertoire of libraries for a range of different tasks.

This enables Python to be a very fast language to work on projects with, as utilities you need your program/script to perform can be imported from other pre-made modules.

In addition, Python is also extremely beginner-friendly.

Due to this ease of use, and rage of modules and libraries, Python is used in many disciplines.

These include, but aren't limited to...
- Webdev due to it's HTTP/API libraries
- Data analysis due to its maths and data visualisation tools
  - Additionally, Python is popular for machine learning because of sklearn and other machine learning modules...
- Task automation
- AI
- Game development

Python is used by nearly every major company, including...
- Intel
- IBM
- Nasa

Python is a good language for scripting, which is why its so popular in devops.

Programs need to be compiled before they're ran so generally run faster

Scripts are interpreted (translated when ran), and are typically smaller and used for automating tasks
