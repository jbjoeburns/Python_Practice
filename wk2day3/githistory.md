## Start
Linux originally used proprietary VCS called BitKeeper as shareware.

Eventually, BitKeeper decided to monitise the software further, and made it no longer free to use.

In response, the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds, made Git as a replacement in 2002.

This had a few key features in mind...
- Speed
- Simple design
- Branched development
- Fully distributed
- Can handle large projects
